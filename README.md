üå¶Ô∏è #Weather Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a Weather Prediction System that predicts whether a specific weather condition will happen or not using Machine Learning algorithms.
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), applying Logistic Regression (LG), and evaluating with different metrics, the model achieves an accuracy of 95% ‚úÖ.
